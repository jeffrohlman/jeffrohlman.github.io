## Projects

### Minesweeper

One of my favorite games of all time is Minesweeper so I decided for my first full project I wanted to recreate it.  I decided to use the [p5 Javascript Library](https://p5js.org/) because of it's built drawing functions.

### One Program a Day

I've alway's heard the best way to master a talent is consistency.  Working at a goal each and every day builds skill.  So I've deicded to attempt to build one program (or portion of a large program) each and every day.
