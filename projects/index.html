          <h4 style="margin: 0; text-align: center;">Created in C</h4>
          <p style="text-align: center;">For our final project we were given a super interesting situation. Given a maze with two robots we had to find the shortest path to their respective exit points without the two robots coliding.  We utilized the Breath Frist Search algorithm and a few cool tricks to complete it. Super fun project I really enjoyed and definitely expanded my thought process for algorithm development.</p>

          <h4 style="margin: 0; text-align: center;">Created in Python</h4>
          <p style="text-align: center;">I have used python occasionally to complete Project Euler and HackRank problems but had never used it in a project.  I wanted to get a little bit of practice with it and conviently the CS:GO major was coming up.  I decided to write a short script to try to predict the outcome of the challenger stage.  I got 4/8 correct oh well :/ The readme in the repo has more info.</p>

          <h4 style="margin: 0; text-align: center;">December 2016</h4>
          <h4 style="margin: 0; text-align: center;">Created in Javascript utilizing the p5 library</h4>
          <p style="text-align: center;">I'm a big fan of minesweeper.  With over 1500 games played and a best time 193s for a 100 mine board on the iPhone I would consider myself pretty good.  So naturally I decided to make minesweeper as a fun project.  I had just learned of the processing library and the newer p5 library based on the original ideas.  Most of the functionality is there but it could definitely be better.  Maybe when I get some free time I'll come back and take another look at it.</p>
