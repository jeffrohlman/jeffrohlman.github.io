        <p style="text-indent: 50px">Hi, I'm Jeff Rohlman and welcome to my site!  I love software development and so I have decided to pursue a career in it.
            I am currently in my first year of a B.S. Computer Science degree with a Minor in Mathematics.
            Even though it is my first year I have previous programming experience through high school classes, side projects, and programming competitions.
            Outside of programming I enjoy swimming, biking, playing video games, and watching movies.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px">In terms of languages I have the most experience with Java and C++, but I am familiar with C, HTML, and CSS.
            If you want to take a look at some of my projects you can click on the projects tab at the top of the page or check out my GitHub listed below.
            Also listed below is a link to my most recently updated resume and my LinkedIn page.

            Thanks for stopping by!</p>
